Overview

This project explores the use of Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as a predictive modeling technique for multi-dimensional datasets. The primary objective is to evaluate different kernel functions—Linear, Polynomial, and Gaussian (RBF)—and assess their effectiveness in reducing prediction errors. By comparing their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), we aim to determine the most suitable kernel for this particular dataset.

Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are:
Implement Kernel Ridge Regression using Python and scikit-learn.
Assess the performance of various kernel functions, including Linear, Polynomial, and Gaussian (RBF), to determine which kernel best captures the data patterns.
Optimize hyperparameters through cross-validation and grid search to improve model performance.
Analyze the computational implications and accuracy trade-offs of different kernel choices.
Interpret the role of kernel functions in transforming feature space for improved predictions.

Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
The dataset used (training_set.csv) consists of multiple features and a target variable. Data preprocessing involved:
Loading and inspecting the dataset for missing values and anomalies.
Splitting the data into features (X) and target (y).
Further dividing the dataset into training and validation sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation.
2. Model Selection and Training
Kernel Ridge Regression was applied using three different kernel functions:
Linear Kernel: Assumes a linear relationship between features and target values.
Polynomial Kernel: Introduces non-linearity by mapping the input data into a higher-dimensional space. A degree-2 polynomial was found to yield the lowest error.
Gaussian (RBF) Kernel: Uses a radial basis function to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
To determine the most effective kernel, cross-validation was conducted, and models were evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. Model Interpretation and Evaluation
The impact of kernel choice was analyzed by comparing the errors of each model.
The Gram Matrix for the polynomial kernel was computed to understand how feature transformations influence predictions.
The polynomial kernel (degree = 2) outperformed other kernels, providing the lowest MSE, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing non-linear relationships in the dataset.

What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the practical applications of Kernel Ridge Regression, including:
Kernel Ridge Regression is highly flexible: By selecting an appropriate kernel, we can effectively model both linear and non-linear relationships.
The choice of kernel has a significant impact on prediction accuracy: The polynomial kernel (degree 2) performed best, highlighting the importance of testing different functions.
Hyperparameter tuning is essential for performance optimization: Adjusting alpha (regularization strength) and kernel-specific parameters can significantly influence model accuracy.
Gram matrices provide a deeper understanding of feature transformations: Studying these matrices helped me visualize how different kernels project data into new spaces.
